# Marks Management System

## Vision

The Marks Management System is a smart contract designed to facilitate the management of student records on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows the contract owner to add new student records, update marks, and apply bonus points. The system is aimed at providing a decentralized and transparent way to manage and query student data.

+---------------------+                       |
```

## Contract Address

The contract address will be available upon deployment. After deploying the contract on the Ethereum network, you will receive the contract address which can be used to interact with the deployed contract.

## Future Scope

1. **Enhanced Functionality**: Introduce additional features such as the ability to delete records or modify existing ones.
2. **Access Control**: Implement role-based access control to allow multiple users with different permissions.
3. **User Interface**: Develop a front-end application for easier interaction with the smart contract.
4. **Security Audits**: Conduct thorough security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
5. **Integration**: Explore integration with other systems or platforms for broader application.
